## Description
This project aims to provide a web app for step.finance, along with a scrapper. The project offers an API ready to be connected, and if you wish to run it locally, follow these steps:
1. Install Express globally: `npm install -g express`.
2. Add the following code to your project: 
```bash
// Add this code to your project
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define the API route
app.get('/getNFTs/:solanaAddress', (req, res) => {
  // Your logic to get JSON of all spaceships in stakes and the respective quantities.
  // You can use the provided `solanaAddress` parameter to fetch the required data.
  res.json(your_json_data_here);
});

// Start the server on localhost:3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started at http://localhost:3000/');
});
Now, you can access the API at localhost:3000/getNFTs/:solanaAddress and get the JSON data of all spaceships in stakes and their respective quantities.
